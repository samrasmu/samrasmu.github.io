  <p style = "color: beige;" > Hi! My name is Sam Rasmussen and I am a current honors student at Indiana University, Bloomington in the Luddy School of Informatics, Computing, and Engineering and the Hutton Honors College. I am expected to graduate in 2023 with a degree in Computer Science. I am interested in either Artificial Intelligence or Cybersecurity and upon receiving my undergradute degree in Computer Science, I want to pursue a Masters in Computer Science and eventually go on to work in either of those fields. When I'm not studying, I enjoy running, reading, and hiking. </p>

  <p style = "color: beige;"> Another project myself and another person worked on is found below. In this project we were instructed to describe the historical implications of ciphers and apply it to today's world. I created a ceaser cipher through excel and VBA along with my partner, Jonathan Benishay in Cybersecurity and Global Policy (Summer 2020). </p>
